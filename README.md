## Responsive Bistro Page

- This is my first project with React which I built from the scratch. 
- It's landing page about bistro, where you can find menu, prices , team who is serving food, reviews of satisfied customers and location of my 'fake' bistro.
- In this project I have learned how to use many css properties like grid, flex, overlay, hover effects and responsive design all that with cooperation with styled components.
- With help of React implemented few generic reusible components which save me lot of lines of code and I can use them in future.
